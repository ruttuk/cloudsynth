# cloudsynth

Cloudsynth is a virtual midi controller where the sound comes from audio blocks that are placed on a grid.

_How it works_

New songs can be created from the main menu and are saved automatically once in edit mode.

*[Left click]* on an empty cell to place a block, *[Right click]* on an existing block to delete it.

To play the current song, press *[space]*. Once the song is playing, press *[space]* again to pause the song.

Press *[R]* to rewind the song to the beginning.

Press *[C]* to toggle between camera views - overhead and perspective.
